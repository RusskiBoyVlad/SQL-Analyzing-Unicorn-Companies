# SQL-Analyzing-Unicorn-Companies

This project is from data camp. It involved creating 2 CTE. 

The first CTE called "top industries" declares the top 3 industries (in years in 2019-2021).

The second one called "yearly ranking" declares the the industries, count of industries, and avg valuation. 

The outer query references yearly ranking in "FROM" and the "top industries" is used to select only the top industries previously defined in the CTE
